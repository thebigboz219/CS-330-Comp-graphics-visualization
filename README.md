TO START WITH: The project would not upload due to size restrictions, so it is in a release attached to this repository.

1. How do I approach designing software:
When it comes to designing software, especially for this project, I found it necessary to read thorugh every bit of code that was given to us a few times to get a good understading of what was going on. From there I researched the more precise code changes necessary for the effects I was going for. The overall "design process" I used when creating this project was more of a limited window. I would work on each section of coding after I came home from work each day, and while I was at work I would mull over details from the previous night and try to think of potential solutions.

2. How do I approach devloping programs?
To be honest I didn't learn any new development strategies when working on this project. One of my previous courses went over different developmental processes and how to go about them. That being said, working on the individual sections of the project over an iterative process did allow me to grasp each part better before I moved on to the next step. If I were to try and implement everything at once, I believe I would have a broken program for quite some time.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My future goals have always been to get into the nuclear field and find ways to help solve the power crisis we all deal with today. Computer science has always been a very interesting secondary profession for me. The knowledge I've gained here will look great when I try to get into a technical profession, and it gives me some new tools to play with in my free time. I plan to continue learning computer science until I can transfer over, unless things work out that makes me go souly into computer science.
